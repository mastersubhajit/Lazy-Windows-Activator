# Lazy Script for Windows Activation

This script is designed to activate Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems using two different methods - HWID and KMS. HWID activation is a permanent activation method that binds the license key to the hardware of the device, while KMS activation uses a Key Management Server to activate the Windows license.

## How to use the script

1. Download the latest version of the script from the GitHub repository.

2. Extract the files from the downloaded ZIP archive.

3. Right-click on the script file and select "Run as administrator".

4. The script will automatically detect the version of Windows running on your device and will prompt you to select the activation method - HWID or KMS.

5. If you select the HWID method, the script will activate Windows permanently by binding the license key to the hardware of the device.

6. If you select the KMS method, the script will connect to a KMS server and activate Windows for a period of 180 days. The activation will be renewed automatically after the expiry of the 180 days.

7. Once the activation process is complete, you will see a confirmation message on the screen.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating system
- Internet connection (for KMS activation method)
- Administrator privileges
